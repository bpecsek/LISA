This is a fork of Lisp-based Intelligent Software Agents (Lisa) from http://lisa.sourceforge.net/
The purpose of this fork is primarily to publish it in notCVS, but I also made some changes, including:
 - Changes to make it compile under CCL (Clozure CL)
 - tolerate empty input lines in the debugger (annoyance)
