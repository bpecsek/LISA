2021-01-30..2021-02-03  George Williams  <george.p.williams@pobox.com>

	* bug fixes:
          - src/core/fact-parser.lisp
               Fix syntax error:
                 In BUILD-ONE-SLOT inside CREATE-TEMPLATE-CLASS-SLOTS:
                   In the call to ERROR
          - src/debugger/lisa-debugger.lisp
               - Fix debugger compiler warning:
	          In (RUN-ENGINE :AFTER (RETE)) inside an anonymous lambda form:
	              Unused lexical variable STEP

	* extensions
	     - misc/toh.lisp
	          Added a new demo file to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle
          - src/reflect/reflect.lisp
               Fix conditional compilation to support CCL (Clozure CL)
          - src/debugger/lisa-debugger.lisp
               Make debugger tolerate empty input lines
	     - src/core/fact.lisp
	          (fact <fact-id>): the documentation says this function
	             exists, but it was not implemented; it is now
	          (ppfact <fact-id>): new function that pretty-prints a
	             fact, it's slots and their values.
          - src/packages/pkgdecl.lisp
	          Exported the following symbols from the LISA package
	          into the LISA-USER package:
	               fact-slot-table, get-fact-list, get-slot-value, ppfact
	     - src/debugger/lisa-debugger.lisp and
	       src/core/watches.lisp
	          Added the ability in the debugger to watch bindings.
	          See the documentation for details.
	* documentation updated:
	     - Show the correct form for loading the debugger is:
	          (require 'lisa-debugger (lisa-system::lisa-debugger))
	     - (consider-taxonomy): doc says default is nil, it's actually t
		     Added additional information about this per David Young in
		     email to the Lisa-users list on 2005-09-09 18:05:27
	     - Updated the defrule documentation to show:
		     - OR pattern is documented, but not implemented;
			  and pointed to an experimental implementation by
			  Jakub Higersberger (Ramarren)
		     - documentation string can be included, and how
		       to access it
	     - Documented find-rule, used to find rule instances
	     - Documented ppfact, used to pretty-print facts
	     - Added note about certainty factors to the list of
	       Things Yet to Do

2007-09-17  David E. Young  <youngde@pobox.com>

	* Release 3.2
	* Fixed bug reported by Aneil Mallavarapu. Lisa's refactored rule
	  parser broke the TEST conditional element.

2007-09-11  David E. Young  <youngde@pobox.com>

	* Release 3.1.
	* Fixed bug reported by Andrew Philpot in Lisa's new conflict
	  resolution machinery. The trouble actually lay in the heap
	  library that Lisa borrowed. This bug affected the retrieval and
	  display of activations.
	* Addressed warnings reported by CLISP and Lispworks when
	  compiling Lisa. Lisa now compiles warning-free on these
	  platforms.
	* Added patch for OpenMCL support. I'm not sure who offered this,
	  so I can't offer proper attribution. Sorry.

2007-09-08  David E. Young  <youngde@pobox.com>

	* This is Lisa release 3.0.
	* Finally beginning a change log for this project.
	* Added support for SBCL. Thanks to Rusian Kosolapov for
  	  submitting some of the patches for this.
	* Fixed an ugly but subtle bug in Lisa's replace-rule
	  mechanism. Whenever an existing rule was replaced with a new
	  version, the old rule's root nodes were retained rather than being
	  removed, eventually drastically reducing performace. Thanks to
	  Andrew Philpot for analyzing and reporting this problem.
	* Significantly improved the performance of Lisa's conflict
	  resolution machinery. Thanks to Edi Weitz for reporting the
	  problem that led to this work.
	* Streamlined Lisa's rule parser.
	* Made the belief system a permanent part of Lisa. There's a
          keyword arg change DEFRULE -- from :cf to :belief -- that will
	  break existing code. Sorry for that.
