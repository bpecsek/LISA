These rules are started out as a version transliterated from the OPS5
(recursive) version in Rule-Based Programming by Kowalski and Levi. I've
modified it significantly to try to make up for the fact that the first
version never worked because it paid no attention to the size of the disks
being moved, and things happened out of order. And the startup magically
assumed that the disks were already in-place. :(

The goal/subgoal system that uses the goal class, the goal-related rules, and the
goal-related functions defined below is how I managed to control the sequencing
of the rules. It's probably not the right way to do things in a rule-based approach,
but it works. Also, this is a pretty general mechanism (sans the application-specific
arguments to the goals).
